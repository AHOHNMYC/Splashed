# Splashed!
Splashed! is a fork of the old Splash! add-on for Firefox.
Need a splash screen while you wait? Old (and maybe some) applications have splash screens to let the user know that there's something happening. Supports Pale Moon, Thunderbird/FossaMail, and maybe SeaMonkey in the future.

## Building
Simply download the contents of the "src" folder  and pack the contents into a .zip file. Then, rename the file to .xpi and drag into the browser.
